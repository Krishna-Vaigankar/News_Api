## Spring Boot News_Api
Api to get source name and its count from the articles which has highest number of occurrence of posting news as per the given parameters.

## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- JDK 1.8
- Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA IDE

I have used IntelliJ IDEA.

## Running the application on IDE

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `com.newsapi.News_App.NewsAppApplication` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can right click on main project and under Run As click on Java Application and select the mail class `NewsAppApplication` from the list.

## Running the application on web browser

- After running the application on IDE, go to web browser `Chrome is recommended`, and type http://localhost:8080/
- On home page there is a input filed where you can paste the news URLs and get the required output.
